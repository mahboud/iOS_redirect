# iOS_redirect
PHP/HTML/JavaScript file that will either open an iOS app, if installed, or fallback to a different URL.

Tested with iOS 8.

This code was built with lots of trial and error, borrowing of code snippets from StackOverflow posts over the years, and sweat and tears.

Use, share and enjoy.
